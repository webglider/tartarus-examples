## Tartarus platform setup

The whole of the Taratarus platform is embedded in a single prolog file usually named `platform.pl`. This file needs to be loaded (consulted) into a SWI Prolog instance, before it can be used. 

The consulting of `platform.pl` and predicates to create a new tartarus platform are demonstrated in the `setup.pl` program in this directory

1. Open an instance of SWI prolog and consult the `setup.pl` using `consult('setup.pl')`. On Windows systems this can be done by directly right clicking on the pl file and clicking open with swi-prolog

2. Run `setup.` in the interactive shell of swi-prolog
